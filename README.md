# Writeups: Reverse Engineering @ UTEP

This repository contains detailed lab reports and write-ups from the Reverse Engineering course at the University of Texas at El Paso (Fall 2024), taught by my mentor, Dr. Mohammad Saidur Rahman.

Each write-up covers practical reverse engineering techniques using industry-standard tools like Ghidra, IDA, YARA, Volatility, and more.

ðŸ§  Whether you're a student, researcher, or cybersecurity enthusiast, you're welcome to use and build on this material â€” just be sure to credit the original lab.

ðŸŽ“ Knowledge is meant to be shared.
ðŸ’¥ Happy hacking, and keep breaking things (ethically)!
